# C++fig

## Configuration library
This is a C++ library that provides a configuration system for applications. It allows you to define configuration options, load them from files, and access them in a type-safe manner.

## Development

The project is structured to use devcontainer for development. To get started, follow these steps:
1. Install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and the [Remote - Containers extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers).
2. Clone the repository to your local machine.
3. Open the repository in Visual Studio Code.
4. When prompted, reopen the repository in a container. This will set up the development environment with all necessary dependencies.
5. Once the container is running, you can build and run the project using the CMake extension.
